Moltres
=======

Moltres is a Discord bot for reporting, coordinating, and joining Pokemon Go
raids.  It was originally designed and written for [Valor of Boston][vob].

Moltres is location-agnostic and can be set up for use in any region.  It
performs best when its host server is outfitted with taggable regional roles,
so that it can use these roles to organize gyms and notify users of raid calls.

Setup
-----

To run an instance of Moltres for your Discord server, first clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/mxw/moltres.git

Next, install all the Node package dependencies.

    # if you have not built libsodium or any C libraries from source, you will likely need this
    sudo apt-get install libtool-bin automake

    # see package.json
    npm install

Install MySQL, e.g.,

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server

and create a database `moltresdb` for use by a user named `moltres`. Then, 
create five tables: `gyms`, `raids`, `calls`, `rsvps`, and `permissions`. The 
script for this is in [setup/moltres.sql], which you can run at the command 
line with:

    mysql -u root -p < setup/moltres.sql
    
    # this will prompt you for the MySQL root password, which is usually prompted for during the apt-get install
    # if you never set up a root password, you can try running as the machine's root user. 
    # Otherwise, you get to google how to reset a MySQL root password.
    # sudo mysql -u root < setup/moltres.sql

Create a Discord bot account by following [these steps][discord-bot]. If you 
already have a Bot created, log in as your user at:

    https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0
    # Copy the Client ID from the top of your bot in Discord's "My Apps"

When adding Moltres to your server, you must grant it the following 
permissions in the channels in which it's active:

*  Read Messages
*  Send Messages
*  Manage Messages
*  Embed Links
*  Read Message History
*  Use External Emojis
*  Add Reactions

Next, add a file `config.js` in the repo's root directory:

    cp setup/config.example.js config.js
    vim config.js # or nano, emacs, whatever editor you prefer.

You may have noticed several references to "Guild IDs", "Channel IDs", and 
other IDs that are numbers and not names. You can get these IDs by enabling 
[**Developer Mode** in your Discord Client][discord-developer-mode], 
right-clicking the entities in question, and hitting Copy ID.

And finally, after all of that configuration, execute:

   ./moltres.sh

Usage
-----

In order for Moltres to be useful, you'll have to manually add gym records to 
the `gyms` table, either via MySQL INSERT queries, or using the `$add-gym` 
command, e.g.,

    $add-gym galaxy-sphere kendall 42.362374 -71.084384 Galaxy: Earth Sphere

You can then retrieve these with:

    $gym galaxy-sphere
    $search sphere # alias for $search-gym
    $gyms kendall # alias for $ls-gyms

intentional about what capabilities to support with a system like this that
integrates with a social-first chat application.
